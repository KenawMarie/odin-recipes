    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ethiopian cabbage dishes, often called Atakilt Wat or Tikil Gomen, are flavorful vegetable stews featuring cabbage, potatoes, and carrots, simmered in a spiced sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup olive oil or niter kibbeh(clarified butter)</li>
        <li>4 medium carrots, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ head green cabbage, shredded</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric, or to taste</li>
        <li>ginger and garlic</li>
        <li>5 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil or niter kibbeh, a clarified butter in a pan over medium heat. Add chopped onions and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir in diced carrots and potatoes. Cook for a few minutes, allowing them to soften slightly. </li>
        <li>Add turmeric, cumin, salt, and pepper to the vegetables. You can also add ginger and garlic at this stage for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded cabbage to the pan and mix well with the other vegetables and spices.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is tender but not mushy. Add a splash of water or broth if the vegetables start to stick.</li>
        <li>add berbere (a spice blend) or jalapeño peppers for heat. You can also add a little more oil or butter for richness. </li>
        <li>Serve Cabbage Dish (the Tikil Gomen hot), often alongside injera (a spongy flatbread) and other Ethiopian dishes. </li>
    </ol>
