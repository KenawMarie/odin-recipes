    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A culinary specialty of the Gurage region of Central Ethiopia, kitfo is a rich and flavorful dish made with minced raw lean beef, spices (the classic Ethiopian spice blend known as mitmita), and an herb-infused clarified butter known as niter kibbeh. Kitfo is renowned for its bold flavor and luxurious texture.</p>
    <p>kitfo incorporates warm, seasoned clarified butter, which makes for a wholly unique flavor experience. The niter kibbeh should be warmed through enough to infuse the meat with its flavors, but should not be so hot that it begins to cook the beef.</p>
